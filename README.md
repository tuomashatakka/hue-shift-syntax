# Hue Shift - Syntax theme for Atom.io

In an early alpha stage, but the default colors do already work.

Make your editor fit your favorite colors.

## Key concepts

- [ ] Configurable hue, saturation and luminance: Make it brighter, more vivid, blue or red with simply moving sliders
- [ ] Fine tuning of discrete colors: override colors you don't like
- [ ] Global diff colors: no more frustration with editor's diff colors differing from the ui's colors 
- [ ] Preview changes real-time
