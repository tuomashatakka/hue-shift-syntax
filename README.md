### Make your editor fit your favorite colors.

Choose any color combination you have ever had a
dream about!

This syntax theme includes a dedicated preview
with sliders for each of its configuration options.

It's as easy as 1, 2, 3 to finally have the
syntax coloring you've always dreamt of!

### Key concepts

Also known as: what to expect when you're looking forward to:

- [x] Configurable hue, saturation and luminance: Make it brighter, more vivid, blue or red with simply moving sliders
- [x] Preview changes real-time
- [ ] Preset saving
- [ ] Fine tuning of discrete colors: override colors you don't like
