# Hue Shift - Syntax theme for Atom.io


★★★★★

It's nice. It's configurable. 

Make your editor fit your favorite colors.

## Key concepts

- [x] Configurable hue, saturation and luminance: Make it brighter, more vivid, blue or red with simply moving sliders
- [ ] Fine tuning of discrete colors: override colors you don't like
- [ ] Global diff colors: no more frustration with editor's diff colors differing from the ui's colors 
- [x] Preview changes real-time
